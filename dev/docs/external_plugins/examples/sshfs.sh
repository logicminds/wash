#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This examples implements an SSH filesystem in Bash.
# The filesystem is laid out as:
#   /sshfs
#     <vm1>
#       <vm1_root_dir>
#     <vm2>
#       <vm2_root_dir>
#     ...
#
# For simplicity, our SSH filesystem consists of two VMs
# specified by the SSHFS_VM_ONE and SSHFS_VM_TWO environment
# variables. The VMs are listed by their fqdns. It is assumed
# that both VMs are known hosts, and that you can ssh into them
# as the root user. For example, it assumes that something like
# "ssh root@<vm> ls" works.
#
# Since Wash passes-in JSON objects to external plugin scripts,
# this example also requires jq to handle the parsing. We will
# eventually add multiple input formats, some of which are more
# "bash" friendly.
#
# If you'd like to try this plugin out, then add the following to
# your plugins.yaml file:
#
#   - name: 'sshfs'
#     script: '<wash_parent>/wash/docs/external_plugins/examples/sshfs.sh'
#
# and start-up the Wash server

# Below are some helpers. The main script comes after them.

# Gets the root directory of a given path. For example, if
# path is something like /sshfs/<vm>/..., then this returns
# /sshfs
function get_root {
  local path="$1"

  echo "${path}" | sed -E 's:.*^/([^/]+).*:\1:'
}

# Strips the root directory of a given path. For example, if
# path is something like /sshfs/<vm>/..., then this returns
# /<vm>/...
function strip_root {
  local path="$1"

    # command is running. Setting up a tty ensures that the remote
    # SSH command is killed when the calling process (our
    # process) is killed. This avoids orphaned SSH processes.
    #
    # NOTE: We make TTY optional because it is one of the passed-in
    # Exec options.
    #

    # author's responsibility, not Wash's.
